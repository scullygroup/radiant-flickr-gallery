h1. Radiant CMS flickr gallery extension 

A quick extension that will embed the square thumbnail of a flickr photo, wrapped in a link to either the large or original sized image for quick gallery creation.  The idea is that you can quickly and easily add inline galleries to your radiant site via a copy and paste radius tag generator in the admin.

h2. Installation

h4. Clone the repo to your radiant extensions directory

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:scullygroup/radiant-flickr-gallery.git vendor/extensions/flickr_gallery
</pre>

h4. Create config/flickr.yml that looks like this

<pre>
key: 77777777777777777777777777777777
secret: 7777777777777777
user: 77777777@N08
</pre>

Replace the 7's with your flickr api key <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/">here</a> and find your flickr user id <a href="http://idgettr.com/">here</a>.

h4. Run the update rake task for the extension

<pre>
rake radiant:extensions:flickr_gallery:update
</pre>

That's all there is to it, and now you have a flickr based gallery that you could fancy up on the front end.  I recommend <a href="http://fancybox.net">fancybox</a> it lets you use css selectors to specify the dom elements you want to make modal box links, and I happen to already have classes built in so it's as easy as this:

<pre>
$("div.flickr-gallery a").fancybox();
</pre>

If you don't want to use fancybox or you just want to modify the dom elements to better suit your needs just edit the app/views/flickr_gallery/_gallery.html.erb
