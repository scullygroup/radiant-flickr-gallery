h1. Radiant CMS flickr gallery extension 

A quick extension that will embed the square thumbnail of a flickr photo, wrapped in a link to either the large or original sized image for quick gallery creation.  The idea is that you can quickly and easily add inline galleries to your radiant site via a copy and paste radius tag generator in the admin.
